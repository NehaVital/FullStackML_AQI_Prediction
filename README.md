# FullStackML_AQI_Prediction
our AQI prediction project combines the efficiency of task automation and API integration for data extraction, followed by dataset hosting through an API and deployment of a machine learning model using Azure. This holistic approach ensures a streamlined and scalable solution for accurate and real-time Air Quality Index predictions.

TASK AUTOMATION USING SELENIUM:
-> Website: [timeanddate.com](https://www.timeanddate.com/)
-> API : [Weatherbit](https://www.weatherbit.io/api/swaggerui/weather-api-v2#/)https://www.weatherbit.io/api/swaggerui/weather-api-v2#/

DATASET - WEBSERVICE:
-> Utilizing Azure Virtual Machines, we host datasets, enhance collaboration, and deploy a responsive machine learning model for real-time predictions.

MACHINE LEARNING - PREDICTION:
-> Algorithm : Boosted Decision tree
-> Accuracy : 80%
-> Results:
